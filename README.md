This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, region, and smoking status. By utilizing machine learning regression algorithms, the model provides insights into how these factors contribute to insurance costs, enabling better cost management.
The following regression algorithms were implemented and evaluated:
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* Gradient Boosting Regressor
* Support Vector Regressor
* k-Fold Cross-Validation
* Grid Search
