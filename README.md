This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, region, and smoking status. By utilizing machine learning regression algorithms, the model provides insights into how these factors contribute to insurance costs, enabling better cost management.
The following regression algorithms were implemented and evaluated:
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor with k-Fold Cross-Validation and Grid Search  
* Random Forest Regressor with k-Fold Cross-Validation and Grid Search  
* Gradient Boosting Regressor with k-Fold Cross-Validation and Grid Search
* Support Vector Regressor with k-Fold Cross-Validation and Grid Search

  Compared all the algorithms results using table
